        <h2>Early LIfe</h2>
        <p>As a child I grew up mostly alone since I am an only child and because of this and my mothers mode of punishment being taking away everything that could be concieved as fun when I got C's in elementary school I had to spend a lot of time in my own thoughts. Because of this by the time I was eight years old I had made the manifestation of what the DC Immortality Avatar is today and who is the main protagonist of my first phase of novels. However he wasn't always Immortal, he became Immortal because of my brushes with death over the years and how it seemed like my body was too stubborn to die and stay dead.
            The first instance of this was when my heart stopped at eight years old the same year I created the character in the first place, I don't rememer anything from that experience except that I was surrounded by darkness and my body was blue before being pulled back to the land of the living with no consquence. That wasn't the last brush with death though because once I got eight years older and reached sixteen I made a lot of bad decisons which led to my heart stopping a second time but this time it was self inflicted. This time though I remembered everything from that breif moment, the all white room, the all white clothes, the white table and the three screen on it.
            One Screen showing the past, one screen showing the present, and one screen that was supposed to show me the future was blank, that's all I'll say on this since this website isn't supposed to be sad or depressing but considering my Pheonix-like qualities I feel this is necessary fo the explanation of why my first phase of characters are Immortal.

        <h2>Why Novels?</h2>
        <p>Now an imperative question that I feel like people would have is why novels? Why not only make games or do something else to convey your stories? It's a simple answer, I don't have the skills yet to make the kinds of games that  I wish to make to convey my stories the way I want them to and I wanted to make Manga but I don't posses the art capabilities to do that. Since my mother is an english teacher writing novels comes very easy to me so I feel like they will be an easy first step for me because I can use them as blueprints of what I want and they can make me money to put into getting the other forms of the stories told.</p>

    <div class="Inspirations">
        <h2>What inspired me?</h2>
        <p>Now for what inspired me to write and create stories where the anime I saw on TV as a child, for instance watching Inuyasha, Bleach, Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, Cowboy Bebop, and more made me want to make my own version and tell my own stories. Those shows made me really want to make something from my imagination because of how vastly different they were from Spongebob and the Disney shows my mom forcced me to watch as a kid. Now though literally anything can inspire me to create a new character or storyline so I keep a notebook of all the possible story ideas while working on the main story ideas that I want to release first.</p>

        <h2>When Did You Actually Start Writing?</h2>
        <p>Now I first started writing my first novel back when I returned from my Andros Island trip in eighth grade making me fourteen at the time, I remeber thinking that the novel was going to have a ton of events all back to back without any character devlopment because I wanted to have super climatic fight scenes over everything else. However as I started to write I started to carer more about the characters and spent more time developing them and with that development came the stretching of the first novel. After I deceided to streatch the first novel next came thinking about how many novels I wanted to be in the series, then came thinking about origin stories, and with origin stories came more characters and with more characters came the mixed multiverse I created. I did finally come to a consensus of where it will all end but not how I'll actually guide the story there just yet but I have time and with time comes practice so I'll get much batter than the first five or so chapters of the first novel that I won't change because it shows how I grow while writing the novel and how the character that is narrating grows aw well. </p>
