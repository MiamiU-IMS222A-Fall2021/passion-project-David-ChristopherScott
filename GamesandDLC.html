        <h2>Games</h2>
        <p>The first game in the series isn't here yet but I'll tell you what it'll be like, I want the first game to be an open world so then the players can explore and become immuresed in the world. With that said though I want there to be combat too so in that regard it'll be a turn based RPG since that would be easier for a novice like me to code plus you can have cool cut aways to fire art as the characters perform their moves. With the open world the player will be able to take on quest and collect items that naturally spawn and they can interact with all the NPC's but the battle aspect will keep them on their toes since they'll have to strategize to survive and keep their items.</p>
    <p>That's only for the first game though since that would work best for it but I do plan on doing other game types such as:
        <ul>
            <li>First Person Shooter</li>
            <li>Third Person Shooter</li>
            <li>Dungeon Crawler</li>
            <li>Traditional Fighting Games</li>
            <li>Mystery</li>
            <li>Co-op</li>
        </ul>
    all of those games would be story based since I want them to further expand on the worlds I've already created and hopefully cross-platform so everyone on any and all cpnsoles can enjoy the games</p>

    <div class="DLC">
        <img style="display: block;" alt="An Open Treasure Chest">
        <h2>DLC</h2>
        <p>Now since there isn't a game there isn't much I can put here besides what I plan to add later on, a major DLC I want to do would be what I want to call "The Multiverse Expansion" which will allow the same original game to have access to the different worlds with slightly differnt mechanics while not making people have to buy fifty versions of the game. This would add entirely different stories and sidequest that the game practically becomes a different game all together and it can have lots and lots of replayability. Plus with that expansion I can change core game mechanics in the different worlds and add meta commentary within the game acknowledging that you are playing/have played the other stories and the game giving you access to different mechanics along with different items.</p>
