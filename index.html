        <h2>Novels</h2>
        <p>The current novel that is in progress is the first novel of the series appropiately titled The Immortals. This novel sets up the world that the series takes place in with two different narraration styles to reflect the differences in the two narrarators which are often confused as the same person despite their stark differences. The final seven or so chapters are being flushed out as well as figuring out the the book cover will actually look like for the finished product, if all goes well though the novel will be published within the next year or two.</p>
    <p>Other novels that are in the works to release that are connected to the first novel are:
        <ul>
            <li>Davi: Untold Destiny</li>
            <li>The dEVIL-Man of Purgatory: Awakening</li>
            <li>The God's Challenge</li>
            <li>That Time I Became A Demon Lord</li>
            <li>The Royals: The Fall Of The King</li>
            <li>X-Calibur</li>
            <li>Numbers: The First Countdown</li>
            <li>Is It Possible To Be A Great Hero Even If You're A Pervert?</li>
        </ul> 
    all of those different novels feature different and sometime recurring characters that will all be important in one way or another, it's up to you readers and game players to figure out how they all tie together and what their purposes are.</p>

        <h2>Games</h2>
        <p>The first game in the series will be faithful to the first novel with some twist added in there, this game will tell the exact same story yes however it will also tell stories that are not included in the first novel. This stories will happen in the form of side quest that will deepen the understanding of all of the characters along with giving hints to how things may transpire in the future novels. This game however unlike the novel will not be out soon, it will likely release in the next three to five years however I will augment the game to have the storyline go up to whatever the current novel at the time is.</p>
