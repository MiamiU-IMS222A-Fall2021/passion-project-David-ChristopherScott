        <h2>Novels</h2>
        <p>The current novel that is in progress is the first novel of the series appropiately titled The Immortals. This novel sets up the world that the series takes place in with two different narraration styles to reflect the differences in the two narrarators which are often confused as the same person despite their stark differences. The final seven or so chapters are being flushed out as well as figuring out the the book cover will actually look like for the finished product, if all goes well though the novel will be published within the next year or two.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="Novels-In-Development">
        <p>Other novels that are in the works to release that are connected to the first novel are:

    <div class="Games">
        <h2>Games</h2>
        <p>The first game in the series will be faithful to the first novel with some twist added in there, this game will tell the exact same story yes however it will also tell stories that are not included in the first novel. This stories will happen in the form of side quest that will deepen the understanding of all of the characters along with giving hints to how things may transpire in the future novels. This game however unlike the novel will not be out soon, it will likely release in the next three to five years however I will augment the game to have the storyline go up to whatever the current novel at the time is.</p>
