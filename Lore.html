   <p>This page has bits and pieces of lore that I'll either change every once in awhile or willl change when Lore Books come out so then the information on this site doesn't become stale</p>

        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>Now I'm not sure how much I should reveal here considering that the first novel hasn't even been techinically completed and isn't realeased but something I will say is this. The Immortal World is much bigger than whatever you are perciving when you imagine it, The Immortal World where the main character lives is the center of all of creation. This means that our world and every world that's ever been created revoles around The Immortal World, Thus The Quantiverse which is a word I created stands for all of creation itself.</p>
    
        <p>Now I would reveal more but I think that, that is a hard enough pill to swallow as is</p>
